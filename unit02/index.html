		<h1>Design Challenge 1</h1>
	
		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<p>Today I'll be talking about two large design and branding agencies, <strong><a href="http://pmbr.tn" target="blank">Pemberton</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.wearefine.com" target="blank">We Are Fine</a>.</strong></p>

		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size, or balance?</h2>
		<p>The first site, <a href="http://pmbr.tn" target="blank">Pemberton,</a> showcases their work either in a right-to-left scrolling action from the homepage, with descriptions of the problems and challenges they were presented with and how they solved them, or in a large photo grouping with scrolling action from top-to-bottom via the Work tab. The logos and text within the photos are nicely balanced and carefully placed with regard to color, contrast, and texture within the grouping. Hovering over the work gives you descriptions of their role in its creation.</p>
		<p><a href="http://www.wearefine.com" target="blank">We Are Fine</a> also features large, prominent images of their work on the homepage. As with the Pemberton site, there is a static top-nav area, but you need to intuitively hover over the three white bars to bring it up. I actually like how the navigation goes away when you're looking at their work, so you can concentrate on the work itself. 

		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
		<p>These two sites are quite similar in how they display their client work. In both sites, the <strong>Work</strong> tabs prominently feature brands they've worked on in large, full-color, 2-column-grid photo formats, set against a small horizontal top-nav band of simple black text on a white background for Pemberton, and white and gray text on black for We are Fine.</p>
		<p>The hierarchy on both is on the work first and about the agency second, with the focal point the thinking behind their work. Despite large imagery and text, both sites are fairly simple, with an eye towards minimalism. What I like about both is that you can see a large scope of their client work in a glance, enabling you to judge the capabilities and approach of each agency quite quickly (before anyone loses patience). Both sites also feature responsive design, shrinking down and simplifying to accommodate a tablet or mobile phone-sized experience.</p>
		<p>On the <a href="http://pmbr.tn" target="blank">Pemberton</a> site, the personality conveyed is knowledgeable, trustworthy, creative, and professional. The <a href="http://www.wearefine.com" target="blank">We Are Fine</a> site also conveys that the agency is knowledgeable, creative, trustworthy, and professional, but there's more. With the hero-image of the big goofy-looking dog, the <i>Bring Friends</i> callout box, and kitschy <i>FINE</i> logo sign, their personality is more playful and fun, which is also shown in their writing style. For example, their tagline of <i>Plus, we're nice</i>, and the <i>Long live your brand</i> callout box on the <strong>Contact</strong> page. That extra spark of personality, for me, gives <a href="http://www.wearefine.com" target="blank">We Are Fine</a> an edge over the competition.</p>
