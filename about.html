		<h1>About Me</h1>
			
	<body>
		<p>Hi. I'm a Graphic Designer/Art Director living just outside Boston in Arlington, MA. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I would like to create a portfolio website. I've been working as a print designer for the past 10 years. Prior to that I worked in web design for a year and a half. Since I was working for large companies, there were front-end and back-end developers doing the coding for me, and I never learned it myself.</p>

		<h2>My Mission</h2>

		<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a UI/UX Designer (user interface and/or user experience designer) with a strategy-oriented agency or company. I'd like to work in a relaxed environment where I can learn interesting things about new companies, their products, and their marketing strategies.</p>
